cd art-lending

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Copy environment variables
cp .env.example .env.local

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

### 2. Understand the Codebase

- Look for issues labeled `good first issue` or `help wanted`
- Comment on an issue to let others know you're working on it

## üìã Development Guidelines

### Code Style

#### TypeScript/JavaScript
- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow ESLint configuration
- Use Prettier for code formatting
- Write descriptive variable and function names

```typescript
// Good
const calculateLoanReturn = (principal: number, multiplier: number): number => {
  return principal * multiplier;
};

// Avoid
const calc = (p, m) => p * m;
```

#### React Components
- Use functional components with hooks
- Implement proper TypeScript interfaces
- Use styled-components for styling
- Keep components focused and reusable

```typescript
interface ArtworkCardProps {
  artwork: Artwork;
  onInvest: (artworkId: string, amount: number) => void;
}

const ArtworkCard: React.FC<ArtworkCardProps> = ({ artwork, onInvest }) => {
  // Component implementation
};
```

#### Smart Contracts
- Follow Solidity best practices
- Include comprehensive NatSpec documentation
- Write thorough tests for all functions
- Use OpenZeppelin contracts where appropriate

```solidity
/**
 * @title LoanContract
 * @dev Manages individual artwork loans
 * @author Open Artist Bank Team
 */
contract LoanContract {
    /**
     * @notice Creates a new loan for an artwork
     * @param _artworkHash IPFS hash of the artwork
     * @param _amount Loan amount in wei
     * @param _estimatedValue Estimated artwork value in wei
     * @return loanId The ID of the created loan
     */
    function createLoan(
        string memory _artworkHash,
        uint256 _amount,
        uint256 _estimatedValue
    ) external returns (uint256 loanId) {
        // Implementation
    }
}
```

### Git Workflow

1. **Create a feature branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes**
   - Write code following the style guidelines
   - Add tests for new functionality
   - Update documentation if needed

3. **Commit your changes**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add loan creation functionality"
   ```

   Use conventional commit messages:
   - `feat:` new features
   - `fix:` bug fixes
   - `docs:` documentation changes
   - `style:` formatting, missing semicolons, etc.
   - `refactor:` code changes that neither fix bugs nor add features
   - `test:` adding or updating tests

4. **Push and create a Pull Request**
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

### Testing Requirements

#### Frontend Testing
```bash
# Run unit tests
npm run test

# Run integration tests
npm run test:integration

# Run E2E tests
npm run test:e2e
```

#### Smart Contract Testing
